This visualisation utilises the dataset of Valencia sourced from Inside Airbnb, 19th March 2023, which encompasses nearly 8000 listings within the city. The dataset includes listings, room type, districts, neighbourhood, average price per listing, and number of reviews. The dashboard allows you to discover which are the districts with the largest number of listings and their respective neighbourhoods.

To make informed decisions and maximize profits, businesses must effectively process and analyze such data. Utilizing an analytics platform has become essential due to the growing market demand. Among the popular platforms, Tableau remains highly regarded. By leveraging Tableau's functionality, complex data from databases and spreadsheets can be transformed into easily understandable information, accessible to a wide range of users. Moreover, Tableau enhances data visualization and comprehension.

One can compare different districts and neighborhoods based on room types or average prices using the available filter. Additionally, the data can be analyzed through a density map, which visually represents the distribution of listings across neighborhoods.
