This visualisation uses the dataset of Valencia from Inside Airbnb, Spain 19 March, 2023. The dashboard allows you to discover wich are the districts with the largest number of listings and its neighbourhoods. 

Compare the different districts/neighbourhoods by room type, or average price with the filter. Another way to analyse the data is by looking the desnity map, which displays the listings by neighbourhoods.
